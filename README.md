# Anomaly Detection on Modelset

This project focuses on implementing anomaly detection techniques on a custom dataset using machine learning models in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook `anomaly-detection-on-modelset.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Application of anomaly detection methods
- Evaluation of detected anomalies
- Insights and interpretation of results

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- StandardScaler for normalization
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for plots

## 📁 Files

- `anomaly-detection-on-modelset.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, analysis, and results.

## 🚀 Getting Started
