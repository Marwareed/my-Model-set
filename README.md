# Anomaly Detection on Modelset

This project focuses on implementing anomaly detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm on the Modelset dataset, which includes ECORE and UML data collections. The workflow is demonstrated in a Jupyter Notebook environment, covering data loading, preprocessing, model training, anomaly detection, and evaluation of the results.

##  Overview

The notebook `anomaly-detection-on-modelset.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Application of anomaly detection methods
- Evaluation of detected anomalies
- Insights and interpretation of results

## Techniques Used

- StandardScaler for normalization
- Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for plots

##  Files

- `anomaly-detection-on-modelset.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, analysis, and results on kaggle.
